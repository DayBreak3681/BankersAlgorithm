# BankersAlgorithm
banker-algorithm Project This is a simple banker algorithm project in C that demonstrates resource allocation and deadlock avoidance. In this project, a producer thread writes data into a shared buffer, and a consumer thread reads data from the same buffer.

Project Components The project consists of the following files:

bankAlg.c: This file contains the code for the banker algorithm.
input.txt: this file contains the inputs needed for the program to work(from the table).

To compile and run the project, follow these steps:

Compile the producer and consumer programs separately:

Copy code 
$ gcc bankAlg.c -o bank
./bank

Execute the banker algorithm in the same terminal and it should compile.
